				Immanuel Kant (1724-1804), the German idealist philosopher, added a sixth argument to it, though Woland doesn’t seem to like it much: “he fashioned his own sixth proof as if in ridicule of himself”.

				Kant’s proof was called the argument of the moral order. Kant said that we are rationally obliged to attain the summum bonum. And what we are obliged to attain, must be possible for us to attain. If there is no God or afterlife, it is not possible to attain the summum bonum, so God or the afterlife must exist.

				In this chapter Woland asserts the existence of yet a seventh proof, which is demonstrated to Berlioz minutes later when he is decapitated by a streetcar – “At least believe that the devil exists! I no longer ask you for anything more. Mind you, there exists a seventh proof of it, the surest of all! And it is going to be presented to you right now!
